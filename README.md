# Single-Cycle-Risc-V-processor
Single Cycle RISC-V Micro Architecture Processor
A fully synthesizable 32-bit processor based on the open-source RISC-V, this processor is designed for targeting lowcost embedded devices. The resulting processor is a single core,
 in-order, non-bus based, RISC-V processor with low hardware complexity. The proposed processor is implemented in Verilog HDL.
